// There were two new features , which were included in Ecma Script 2016 (ES7)

// 1. Array search Prototype:
// Let's suppose that we have an array

let an_Array = [7, 9, 24, 34, 123, 90, 45, 23, 70];
console.log(an_Array.includes(45)); // it will return true if there is some thing present in our that array , otherwise it will return 'false'

// 2. To calculate the power of any function according to your desire
console.log(2 ** 4); // it will return the '4' times power of '02'
