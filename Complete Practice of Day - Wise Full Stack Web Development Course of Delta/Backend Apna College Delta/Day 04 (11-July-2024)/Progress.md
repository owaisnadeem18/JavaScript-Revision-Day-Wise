# Use cases of Express JS

- To listen the requests of http 
- To parse these text form of requests into objects
- To send the suitable responses as per the requirements of http requests
- Route http requests 

# Listening to HTTP Requests:

Express.js is used to set up a server that listens for incoming HTTP requests.

# Parsing Requests:

It parses incoming requests, especially POST requests, and converts them from text or JSON into JavaScript objects using middleware like body-parser.

# Sending Responses:

It sends appropriate HTTP responses back to the client, including HTML, JSON, or other data formats.

# Routing HTTP Requests:

It handles routing of requests, directing them to different handlers based on the URL and HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
