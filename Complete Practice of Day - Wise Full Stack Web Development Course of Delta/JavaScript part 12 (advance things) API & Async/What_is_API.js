// An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. It defines the methods and data formats that applications can use to communicate with each other, enabling them to request and exchange information or perform actions without needing to understand the internal workings of each other. Essentially, APIs allow different software systems to talk to each other in a standardized way.
