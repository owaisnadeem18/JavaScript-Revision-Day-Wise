// "JS is single threaded" this means that JS can only perform one task at a time and if we talk about the asynchronous and awaiting nature of JS , then some one can say that JS is doing multi tasks at the same time i.e it is not only printing and executing the below lines , but it is also doing waiting for the set time out function to get executed , then the answer is that JS does not perform waiting operation , these waiting operations are performed by the browser , so JS keep executing the different statments , while browser keep waiting for the other instructions to get executed . At the end after completion of wait time , the broser put that function in the call stack of JS & JS can perform that task after it.
